* Introduction

** neuroGrape is a free UCI chess engine based on Grapefruit [fn:1]
** which is based on based on Toga II 1.4 beta5c. neuroGrape is an
** attempt to integrate a backpropagation neural network as an
** evaluation function.  The engine has 4 modes of play, controlled by
** the "Mode" UCI parameter:

0 - original Grapefruit eval is logged to files.  There has to be a
`logs' directory along the neuroGrape executable.  These log files can
be processed by the neuroChessTrainer [fn:2] program to train and test
networks.  This mode can work correctly only on single thread so be
sure to specify "Threads" UCI parameter as 1.

1 - online training.  The original Grapefruit eval is used to train the
network specified by the "Neural Network File" UCI parameter while
neuroGrape is playing like Grapefruit, albeit way slower.  The neural
network file format can be found at [fn:2] (not fully specified
network is also allowed).  Newly trained network is saved to the same
file when engine is unloaded.  For this mode a single engine thread is
also mandatory but there is additional "Training Threads" UCI
parameter which specifies number of threads within the neural network.

2 - neural network specified by "Neural Network File" UCI parameter is
used for evaluation (again not fully specified network is also
allowed but it will be freshly initialized and thus playing about
randomly).  Multiple threads specified by the "Threads" UCI parameter
are allowed.

3 - original Grapefruit playing.

* MISC

** neuroGrape is developed and so far only tested on GNU/Linux.
** To build from source invoke `make all' in the source directory.

* Disclaimer

** neuroGrape is an experiment and in combination with
** neuroChessTrainer [fn:2] supposed to be testing framework for
** different backpropagation neural networks.  There are no
** expectations for engine strength and as far as hardly trained, it
** plays like a novice drunkard.
